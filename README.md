![ROS1 inhibitor compound 31](data/AZ-ROS1-inhibitor-31.png)

**31.sdf** is a ROS1 inhibitor hit ( compound 13 ) discovered by Petrović, D. et al. (2022) through Fragment-Based Drug Discovery (FBDD). In this exercise, it serves as the **query** for ROSHAMBO2. Compound 13 underwent structure preparation using Flare, followed by conformational searching and alignment via the "Conf Hunt & Align" module. This process generated the bioactive conformation (bound conformer) by aligning the compound to the ligands in three ROS1 co-crystal structures (PDB: 3ZBF, 4UXL, 7Z5X).
